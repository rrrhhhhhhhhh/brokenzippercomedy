    			<div class="title" style="color:#DA70D6;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allie Furlotti</div>
    				<div class="bio">Allie has always wanted to be a performer. Even though she  fell in love with
    				 stand up and sketch comedy, she was too afraid to stand up and try it.  But
    	 		 	 now she hosts mics and showcases and co-produces shows as Broken Zipper.  Allie
    	  	 	 loves the community Broken Zipper creates because the audience is supportive
    		 	 	 and the comics are diverse and love their craft. Allie has a style of comedy
    		  	 which is a mix of stories, performance art and weird observations.</div>

    			 <div class="bio">When Dorothy started standup, she had no idea she would become so caught
    				  up in the Portland comedy community.  The comedians and audience, who
    					are almost all much younger, welcomed her to standup as a performer and
    					 host. Now Dorothy also loves co-producing Broken Zipper Comedy shows
    					 that represent the full range of diverse comedians and comedic styles
    					 from Portland and out of state comedians.  She also actively supports
    					 the growth of new comedians.</div>
